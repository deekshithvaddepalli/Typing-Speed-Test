# CVIP-PYTHONDEVELOPMENT-PHASE2-NORMALTASK

A simple desktop-based Typing Speed Test application developed using Python and Tkinter.
This project helps users measure their typing speed by calculating Words Per Minute (WPM) based on how quickly and accurately a displayed word is typed.

**🔹 Features**

Random word generation for each test

Real-time typing speed calculation (WPM)

User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter

Instant feedback for correct and incorrect inputs

Automatic reset for continuous practice

**🔹 Technologies Used**

Python

Tkinter (GUI)

Random & Time modules

**🔹 Purpose**

This project was created as part of my learning journey to understand:

GUI application development in Python

Event handling and timing mechanisms

Basic performance measurement logic
**🔹 How It Works**

A random word is displayed on the screen

User types the word and presses Enter

The application calculates typing speed in WPM

Feedback is shown and the test restarts automatically
